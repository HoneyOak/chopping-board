# Road to Chopping Board
Total hours so far: 
## 2025-07-11 Research (1.5 hours)
Exploring current keyboard options and noting what I want. I like the minimalism of the Totem and the layout of the Corne. A low profile keyboard is a must. Aesthetics are just as important as ergonomics.
Perhaps, then, a slightly staggered layout with a simple thumb cluster is what I should be going for.

## 2025-07-12 Schematic (2 hours)
Done with a quick schematic! Decided the components I need: nice nano v2 MCU, hotswappable choc switches, diodes, knob, and an oled. As a bonus, the schematic for the two halves are the exact same. I plan to make a flippable PCB so I don't need to order 5 of each half.

## 2025-07-14 PCB design (8 hours)
After hours of fiddling with grids and splayed layouts in KiCAD, and the flippabality headache at the back of my mind, I surrender. I surrender to ergogen my beloved. Not sure if this is against the rules, but I just need the PCB Layout from on here. I have the schematic already, just need the components placed in the right layout (and the pcb to be flippable). Anyway, after a long side quest here's what I came up with:

So beautiful. Headache over.

## 2025-07-16 CAD design (1 hour)

Just importing the files of the PCB and the components into an OnShape assembly. Here's what it looks so far:

The actual case is yet to be made!


## 2025-07-16 Back to KiCAD for a bit (1.5 hours)
Fixed up the layout, added 3d models. Routing is still TBD, but the rest is laid out!

## 2025-07-21 CAD (5.5 hours)
Almost done with cad! Really like how this has been coming. Lots of progress on the BOM too.
